# 🌤️ SwiftUI Weather App

This is a simple weather app UI built with SwiftUI. It displays a weekly weather forecast and allows users to toggle between day and night mode. This project helped me learn the fundamentals of SwiftUI, including:

- Stacks (`VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`)
- Passing parameters to views
- Using `@State` and `@Binding`
- Creating and organizing views using `struct`
- Refactoring code for reusability and clarity

## 📱 Features

- Display of city name and current weather
- 5-day forecast using reusable view components
- Toggle between day and night background themes with a button
- Responsive layout using SwiftUI stacks and modifiers
- System SF Symbols used for weather icons

## 🧪 What I Learned

- How to build user interfaces declaratively using SwiftUI.
- Managing view state with `@State` and passing it using `@Binding`.
- How to break down complex views into smaller, reusable components.
- Basic understanding of SwiftUI modifiers and layout principles.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Make sure the SwiftUI canvas is enabled (click the "canvas" button in the top-right).
3. Run the preview or build to simulator.
4. Click the "Change Mode" button to toggle between day and night.
